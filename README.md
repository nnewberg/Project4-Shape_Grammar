##Project 4 Shape Grammars

Welcome to my city of the future. feel the vapors. The city radiates from the center as the density of buildings decrease <br><br>

The wavy terrain is generated by perlin noise and it's frequency and amplitude increases from the center.<br><br>

The suburban sprawl is generated by computing the nearly perpendicular face normals of the terrain and choosing an arbitrary number of them to spawn buildings. (check out with debug mode)<br><br>

I am using shape grammars which subdivide, tower, vary heights and stretch skyscrapers. Towers generate more densly in the center and cannot be subdivided once created.
